# Install Node.js and Vue.js in Windows

1. Official Installer (Recommended):
- Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Download the Windows Installer (.msi file)
- Choose between LTS (Long Term Support) or Current version
- Double-click the downloaded file
- Follow the installation wizard
- Select "Add to PATH" during installation

2. Using Chocolatey (Package Manager):
```powershell
# First, install Chocolatey (if not already installed)
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Then install Node.js
choco install nodejs
```

3. Using NVM for Windows:
```powershell
# Install NVM for Windows
# Go to https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
# Download and run the nvm-setup.exe

# After installation, open Command Prompt and run:
nvm install latest
nvm use <version>
```

Verification Steps:
```powershell
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Check npm version
npm --version
```

Pros of Each Method:
- Official Installer: Simplest, most straightforward
- Chocolatey: Easy management of packages
- NVM: Most flexible, allows multiple Node.js versions

Tips:
- Restart your command prompt/PowerShell after installation
- Choose LTS version for stability
- NVM is best for developers who need multiple Node versions

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these installation methods?
